    "content": "Responsive web design has evolved far beyond simple media queries. Today's web applications need to adapt intelligently to an ever-growing variety of devices and user contexts.\n\nModern responsive techniques include:\n\n1. **Container Queries**: Style elements based on their container size, not just viewport\n2. **Fluid Typography**: Using clamp() and viewport units for scalable text\n3. **CSS Grid**: Creating complex, flexible layouts with minimal code\n4. **Flexbox**: Perfect for component-level responsiveness\n5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting mobile-first and enhancing for larger screens\n\nThe key is thinking beyond device categories and focusing on content adaptation. Consider how your interface elements should behave at different sizes, and use modern CSS features to create truly fluid experiences.",

    "excerpt": "How serverless computing is changing the way we build and deploy web applications, from development to production.",
    "content": "Serverless architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we think about backend development. By abstracting away server management, developers can focus purely on business logic and user value.\n\nKey benefits of serverless:\n\n- **Automatic Scaling**: Handle traffic spikes without manual intervention\n- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual execution time\n- **Reduced Complexity**: No server provisioning or maintenance\n- **Faster Time to Market**: Focus on features, not infrastructure\n- **Global Distribution**: Built-in edge computing capabilities\n\nPopular serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, and Cloudflare Workers are making it easier than ever to deploy scalable applications. The serverless ecosystem now includes databases, storage, and even entire frontend frameworks designed for this paradigm.\n\nWhile serverless isn't suitable for every use case, it's becoming the default choice for many modern web applications.",
